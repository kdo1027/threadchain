# threadchain

A decentralized social media platform that empowers users with full ownership and control over their data while facing algorithmic content filtering. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, the platform allows for tokenization, where users can own digital assets tied to their content or profiles, while ensuring a transparent ecosystem for sharing content and opinions.
